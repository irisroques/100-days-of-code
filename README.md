:pushpin: Repo to keep track of my progress on the 100 days of code challenge (for coding outside of other bigger projects)

:diamonds: ~In this repository I intent to get from 0 to more advanced python topics as the days go, but really understanding how to work with the language~

:clock10: I take 1 hour of my day to do the callenge, also I decided to not count the coding I do for work or for University (at least for this repo)

:blue_book: I'll be focusing on GoLang and following the book http://www.golangbootcamp.com/ :nerd_face:

After that we will see :dart:
